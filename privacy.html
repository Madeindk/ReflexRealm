  <main>
    <p>This policy applies to all apps developed and published by <strong>MadeInDK</strong>, unless an app-specific policy states otherwise.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Our apps themselves do not collect, store, or share personal information with us directly. App data remains on the user’s device and is not transmitted to our own servers.</p>

    <h2>Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
    <p>Some of our apps use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads. AdMob may collect and process certain data automatically, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (such as Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers — IDFA, if permission is granted)</li>
      <li>Approximate location data</li>
      <li>App usage information (e.g. which screens are viewed, interactions with ads)</li>
      <li>Diagnostic and performance data to improve ad delivery</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used to provide personalized or non-personalized ads, to limit repetitive ads, and to measure ad effectiveness. Users can control whether personalized ads are allowed via the system’s <em>App Tracking Transparency</em> prompt and iOS privacy settings.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our apps are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If a parent or guardian believes a child has provided personal data through ads, please contact us and we will work with our partners to address it.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>You can review Google’s AdMob privacy policy here:
